# Bad Apple for Vector-06c with vi53 music

This is yet another Bad Apple for a strange computer.

It comprises 3024 64x48 monochrome frames packed into 227630 bytes, which averages at 75.27 bytes per frame. The video plays back at 12.5fps.

The codec can optionally use lossy encoding, but this function is unused in this version. Lossy encoding would allow to fit 25fps video in Vector-06c memory, but the limiting factor is playback performance.

The music is played using built-in 3-channel 8253 timer. Apologies for the liberties I had to take to make this custom arrangement possible.
